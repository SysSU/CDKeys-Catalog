***INSTALLATION***
Step 1: Upload all the files to preferred folder
Step 2: Create database and import users.sql and cd_keys.sql to your database
Step 3: Open up includes/config.php and make changes to database information to match yours
Step 4: Login with username "admin" and password "password"
Step 5: Go to admin link and change password for "admin"
Step 6: Start creating your keys!

***NOTES***
- The database admin was created just for testing purposes and has no real purpose in the script. I left it there because someone might find it useful. If you dont want to use it delete modules/admin/createdatabase.php then edit modules/admin/home.php and get rid of the link to the database admin.
